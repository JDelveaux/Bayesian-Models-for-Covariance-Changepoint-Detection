# Bayesian Models for Covariance Changepoint Detection
 A report submitted for the degree of MSc in Non-Equilibrium Systems

Herein, we investigate two parametric Bayesian changepoint detection algorithms, the Hidden
 Markov Model (HMM) and Product Partition Model (PPM) with applications to finding changes
 in the covariance structure in multivariate signals. Both models were ran on several synthetic and
 empirical data sets, including various distributions of correlated random variables (r.v.s), industry
 portfolio data, and rainfall observations. Bootstrapping methods were performed to determine
 thresholds for change-detection in the PPM. In-depth investigations revealed with high probability
 that the methods were indeed detecting changes in the covariance structure of the data. For
 comparison, we used a non-parametric binary segmentation (BS) algorithm to compare the results.
 We find in nearly all cases the non-parametric BS method outperforms the HMM and PPM in both
 computation time and accuracy
